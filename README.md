# Busy-Beaver-Turing-Machine
Busy Beaver Problem aims at finding the best turing machine which produces maximum number of 1's on an infinite length tape cell initially filled with all 0's 
and which finally halts. 

It consists of  symbols (m) and states (n).

Two functions are defined for a Busy Beaver Problem :-
     
     1. Σ(n,m): the largest number of 1's(or non 0's in case of symbols >2) printable by an n-state m-symbols machine before halting, 
     
     2. S(n,m): the largest number of steps taken by an n-state m-symbols machine before halting.

The code is for 2 symbols (0 and 1) and 5 different states (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and
computes  Σ(n,m) and S(n,m) for the best turing machines for each states.

We have also simulated 2 state 2 symbols and 3 state 2 symbols Busy Beaver Turing Machine on online simulator https://turingmachine.io/
